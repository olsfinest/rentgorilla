<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<h5>Q: What happens if I upgrade to a higher capacity plan?</h5>
<p>A: Billing-wise, we immediately create a line item for the remaining portion of the current billing period at the new plan rate. At the next scheduled billing, the customer is charged for the line item and the full charge for the upcoming period, less the account balance. If the account balance amount is larger than the amount due, the customer is not charged anything, and the account balance is carried over to future billing periods, until it’s spent down.</p>
<h5>Q: What happens if I downgrade to a lower capacity plan?</h5>
<p>A: We will deactivate some of your properties if necessary to compensate for the new plan's lower capacity. Be sure to confirm that you activate your desired properties.

<h5>Q: I have a legacy plan - what do I do now?</h5>
<p>A: Please consider swapping to one of the new plans. If your legacy plan was more expensive than a new plan (e.g. you paid for a yearly plan) the account balance is carried over to the future billing of your new plan.</p>
